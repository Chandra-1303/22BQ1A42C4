### ✅ Technical Implementation

#### 🏗️ Architecture & Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast development and building)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility-first, responsive)
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight, TypeScript-friendly)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict mode

#### 🎨 UI Components & Design
- **Custom Component Library**: Button, Input, Card, Loading, Toast
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design with breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **User Experience**: Loading states, error feedback, animations

#### 🔧 Features Implemented

- **Dashboard**: Real-time statistics and activity feed
- **Products Page**: Grid layout with filtering and categories
- **Test Submission Component**: As specified in requirements
- **Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with active states
- **Notifications**: Toast system for user feedback

### ✅ Logging Middleware Implementation (As Required)

#### 📁 File Structure Created:
```
logging-middleware/
└── logger.ts          # Custom logging middleware

frontend-test-submission/
└── MyComponent.tsx     # Test submission component with logging
```

#### 🔍 Logging Features:
- ✅ First function in components uses logging middleware
- ✅ Logs all user actions and API calls
- ✅ Multiple log levels (debug, info, warning, error)
- ✅ Sends logs to external service (http://20.244.56.144/evaluation-service/logs)
- ✅ Contextual information in all log messages

### ✅ Code Quality & Testing

#### 🧪 Testing Setup:
- Vitest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock setup for external dependencies
- All tests passing (8/8 tests successful)

#### 📋 Code Quality:
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint configuration with React rules
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- No compilation errors
- Production build successful
